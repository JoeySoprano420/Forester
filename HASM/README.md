Hasm: Hexadecimal-Assembly Language
Definition:
Hasm is a symbolic programming language that bridges raw hexadecimal representation and low-level assembly semantics. Designed for maximal control over binary structure, it allows developers to write programs where each opcode, byte alignment, and memory layout is explicitly defined in hex form—but with symbolic tags, macros, and minimal syntax sugar for legibility and structure.

Core Characteristics:
Hex-Centric Syntax: Every instruction, data block, or directive is structured around hexadecimal literals.

Assembly Semantics: Maps directly to x86_64 (or other arch-specific) assembly instructions, but abstracted into clean symbolic hex patterns.

Zero-Parser Flow: Each line is meant to be instantly translatable—1-to-1—from symbol to binary, suitable for bootloaders, exploit crafting, bare metal firmware, or ROM injection.

Direct Memory Manipulation: Exposes direct hex-level control over stack, heap, and registers.

Visual Patterning: Programmers can see opcode flows and segment transitions through color-coded or spatial hex groupings.
